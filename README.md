An application for calculating the rule of three.

## Rule of three

The rule of three is a method of cross-multiplication used to solve problems involving proportionality between three known values and one unknown.

For an equation in the form:

$$
\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{x}
$$

where the variable to be evaluated is in the right-hand denominator, the Rule of Three states that: 

$$
x=\frac{bc}{a}
$$

In this context, *a* is referred to as the extreme of the proportion, and *b* and *c* are called the means.
